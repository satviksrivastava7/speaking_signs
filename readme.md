# Speaking Signs
## sound to speechless

This repository is to manage the streamlit web application for real time Sign Language Detection. The aim of this repo is to establish communication, act as a translator, and serve as a platform to learn Sign Language.
Currently the model is trained on MNIST American Sign Language, but I am workin on adding other sign langiuage models as well.
